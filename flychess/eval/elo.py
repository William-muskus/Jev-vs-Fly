"""Match play and Elo estimation (docs/SPEC.md eval/elo.py).

``play_match`` plays every game of a match in lockstep so that a :class:`BrainPolicyPlayer` can
evaluate all boards where it is to move in a single batched forward pass; players without
``choose_many`` are simply called board by board.  Games truncated at ``max_plies`` count as draws.

Game termination follows the project-wide rule in :func:`flychess.train.mcts.terminal_value` (the one
used by self-play, ``fly play`` and the web engine): checkmate, stalemate, insufficient material,
50-move rule and threefold repetition of the *current* position. ``Board.is_game_over(claim_draw=True)``
is deliberately not used — python-chess evaluates claimable draws *before* the side to move plays, so
a player with a mate in one would be awarded a draw instead of delivering it.

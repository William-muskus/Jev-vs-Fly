"""Play against the fly: engine (§9 difficulties), terminal UI and the local website server.

The module object is callable: ``flychess.play(run, difficulty=..., color=..., gui=False)`` is the
public entry point (SPEC §0) and importing this sub-package rebinds ``flychess.play`` to the module,
so the module forwards calls to the implementation in ``flychess/__init__.py``.

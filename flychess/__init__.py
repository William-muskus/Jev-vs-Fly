"""fly-chess: a chess engine whose neural network *is* the FlyWire fruit-fly connectome.

Public API (docs/SPEC.md §0 / §6)::

    import flychess
    flychess.train(run="fly1", stage="all", config="configs/default.yaml", max_steps=1000)
    model, graph = flychess.load_brain("fly1")          # run name, run dir or checkpoint path
    flychess.play("fly1", difficulty="fly", color="white")   # terminal UI; gui=True serves web/

Heavy modules (torch, rich, fastapi) are imported lazily so that ``import flychess`` stays cheap
and ``fly --help`` works without loading a GPU stack.

``flychess.train`` / ``flychess.play`` are also the names of the ``flychess.train`` and
``flychess.play`` sub-packages: importing either sub-package rebinds the attribute on this package
to the module (Python's import machinery does that). Both sub-packages therefore make their module
object *callable* with exactly the same signature (see their ``__init__``), so ``flychess.train(...)``
and ``flychess.play(...)`` work whether or not the sub-packages have been imported.
